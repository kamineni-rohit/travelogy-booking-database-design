# Travelogy Booking Database Design

This project focuses on building a robust SQL-based database system to support a seamless and centralized booking experience for Travelogy, a fictional online travel agency.

## 🧠 Objective
To unify and optimize the travel booking workflow by consolidating services like flights, hotels, car rentals, and travel insurance into a single database system—eliminating vendor redirects and enabling personalized user experiences.

## 💡 Background
Travelogy has traditionally acted as a service aggregator, redirecting customers to vendor platforms for final bookings. While functional, this structure led to:
- Fragmented user experience
- Inefficient vendor commission tracking
- Difficulty in personalizing travel recommendations
- Inconsistent service quality across vendors

## 🔧 Proposed Solution
The project introduces a redesigned booking database system that:
- Integrates all travel services (flights, trains, hotels, car rentals, insurance)
- Tracks user interactions, feedback, and preferences
- Enables bookings and service changes directly from Travelogy's platform
- Supports personalized recommendations via centralized customer data

## 🔗 Features & Benefits
- **Unified Platform**: Users can complete entire trips without leaving Travelogy.
- **Single Transaction Flow**: Book multiple services together in one go.
- **Enhanced Experience**: Captures feedback and preferences for personalized suggestions.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Improves vendor management and commission workflows.
- **Scalable Design**: Prepares Travelogy to integrate future services without overhauling the system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (Database schema design)
- ER Diagrams
- Entity-Relationship Modeling
- Conceptual & Logical DB Design

## 📌 Notes
- This project is an academic exercise; the business, platform, and data are fictional.
- Final schema and sample queries can be extended into a real database or web app.
